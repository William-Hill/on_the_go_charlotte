Just outside of the Redwoods on the way to Ashland, Oregon, Humboldt county hosts the small towns of Eureka, Arcata and Blue Lake. I didn’t expect to find so much activity in these quaint small towns. But they are home to various age groups and small businesses. Blue Lake is home to Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theatre. With three different stage venues, the school attracts new comers as well as decades worth of returning community members. Next to their River campus is Mad River Brewery. Serving up typical bar food, local brews and  cider, Mad River has a great outdoor patio for live music and dancing. I had the BBQ burger with avocado instead of pork bacon plus a local cherry cider. In Arcata, one street over from the town square after the Fairy Festival is a Cider Bar called The Local. After making a selection from the wall of possibilities (there are about 15-17 ciders on tap y'all!) walk two paces to the left of the cider register to get a Slice of Humboldt Pie. Peach was in season so I went to indulge. Along with fruit, chocolate, or nut pie combinations are empanadas so tasty you will want to scream. On a fine Sunday morning I found myself being treated to brunch at The Green Lily. Outside was a sign that read "Everything is better with a mimosa" This would be my kind of place. Not only are mimosas available, there was a FLIGHT OF MIMOSA! With flavors like watermelon, strawberry guava, mango, grapefruit, who was I to choose just one? For food I chose a veggie omelet with breakfast potatoes. However, the lobster benedict also called me. I was jealous of dish. If you're able to indulge, stay at least one night in the historic Eureka Inn. So much historical significance to witness. Test your film history and see if you recognize scenes. 

Here are my top recommendations for Humboldt County:   

on the town Event: Fairy Festival in Arcata

one the spot Landmark: Dell'Arte International in Blue Lake

on the menu: The Green Lily in Eureka for brunch 

Peace, love, and travels!
