Just outside of the Redwoods on the way to Ashland, Oregon, Humboldt county hosts the small towns of Eureka, Arcata and Blue Lake. I didn’t expect to find so much activity in these quant small towns. But they are home to various age groups and small businesses. Blue Lake is home to Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theatre. With three different stage venues, the school attracts new comers as well as decades worth of returning community members. Next to their River campus is Mad River Brewery. Serving up typical bar food, local brews and  cider, Mad River has a great outdoor patio for live music and dancing.
