The United States Virgin Islands consist of St Thomas, St John, and St Croix. St Thomas and St John are a short ferry ride apart. Cruise ships dock in the harbor of Charlotte Amalie. Here passengers can off board for a day's excursion or shop til they drop duty free! St. John features a wonderful eco tour and less crowded beaches to explore. St. Croix is a 2 hour ferry boat ride from St. Thomas. (I experienced sea sickness the first time making this journey!) St Croix is more laid back known for the famous Cruzan lifestyle. There is no rush or hurry applied here. Just enjoy the less stress portion of life. Last year I stayed in Christiansted, St. Croix. This year was Charlotte Amalie (west), St Thomas.  

The sun is FOREVER shining in the Caribbean! Well, its pretty much always hot and humid because you get a few rain showers here and there. One day I was trapped at a book store on the campus of UVI because the bottom of the sky fell and rain came down in sheets! The lady at the front tried to press me to purchase an umbrella. This wasn't my first rodeo; I knew the rain would stop at some point. :) 

Food is special here. I had oxtails so good it made me want to cry. They reminded me of my great-great aunt Eloise who has ascended now 6 years ago. It brought back her voice and smile for me. The plantains were so beautiful- not too sweet and not too green. 

Above I mentioned the Eco tour on St. John. The guide was well verse
