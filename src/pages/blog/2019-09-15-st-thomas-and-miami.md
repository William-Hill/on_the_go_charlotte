The United States Virgin Islands consist of St Thomas, St John, and St Croix. St Thomas and St John are a short ferry ride apart. Cruise ships dock in the harbor of Charlotte Amalie. Here passengers can off board for a day's excursion or shop til they drop duty free! St. John features a wonderful eco tour and less crowded beaches to explore. St. Croix is a 2 hour ferry boat ride from St. Thomas. (I experienced sea sickness the first time making this journey!) St Croix is more laid back known for the famous Cruzan lifestyle. There is no rush or hurry applied here. Just enjoy the less stress portion of life. Last year I stayed in Christiansted, St. Croix. This year was Charlotte Amalie (west), St Thomas.  

The sun is FOREVER shining in the Caribbean! Well, its pretty much always hot and humid because you get a few rain showers here and there. One day I was trapped at a book store on the campus of UVI because the bottom of the sky fell and rain came down in sheets! The lady at the front tried to press me to purchase an umbrella. This wasn't my first rodeo; I knew the rain would stop at some point. :) 

Food is special here. I had oxtails so good it made me want to cry. They reminded me of my great-great aunt Eloise who has ascended now 6 years ago. It brought back her voice and smile for me. The plantains were so beautiful- not too sweet and not too green. 

Above I mentioned the Eco tour on St. John. The guide was well versed in the history of the land, how colonization and invasion has changed it, and what the local conservative efforts are to protect/preserve the land. I was able to Hike, kayak, and snorkel for one package deal! Oh and I met several giant turtles. At the beginning of snorkeling tour portion, we were advised on the hefty fine from touching a protected creature. So, if a turtle is swimming toward you, put your hands behind your back so you aren't at fault for contact. I had a tiny freak out because I didn't want to harm the turtle when it came up to the surface toward me. Pretty sure he saw the panic on my face and found me uninteresting once he surfaced.
